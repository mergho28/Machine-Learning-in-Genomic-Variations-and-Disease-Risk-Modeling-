# Machine-Learning-in-Genomic-Variations-and-Disease-Risk-Modeling-
This Python program uses TensorFlow to build a neural network for predicting disease from genomic data. It features a Tkinter GUI for file selection, data processing with pandas and scikit-learn, and visualizations with matplotlib. SHAP explains feature importance in model predictions.
